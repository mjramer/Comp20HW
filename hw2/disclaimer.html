	<h5>This website is a giant, but creative joke.  When I was thinking about a possible charity/business organization for which to make a website, for some reason I thought of the really funny scene from "Zoolander" (shown in the home page). <br><br> The content, descriptions, and title headers were written as if Derek Zoolander and his associates created this website for his hypothetical center.  The entire website pokes fun at the heart of the dumb-comedy movie; namely that Derek Zoolander is a dim-witted, self-absorbed person with little common-sense.  Characters and plot points from the movie are referenced throughout the website.<br><br> </h5> 
	<u>In no way did I mean to offend or upset anyone with the content of this website.<br><br></u>
	<h5>Hope you enjoy!</h5>
